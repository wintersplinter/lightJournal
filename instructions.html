      <h2>What LightJournal is</h2>
      <p>
        LightJournal is a simple, encrypted journal. Entries are stored in your
        own Google Drive (private app data). The app never needs a server. Your
        passphrase is required to decrypt and read your journal.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick start</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open LightJournal.</li>
        <li>
          Press <strong>Connect to Google Drive</strong> and approve access.
        </li>
        <li>Enter your <strong>passphrase</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          If a journal exists for that passphrase, posts load automatically. If
          not, write a note and press <strong>Save</strong> to create it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Writing and saving</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write</strong> in the editor.</li>
        <li>
          Press <strong>Save</strong> to encrypt your note and upload it to
          Google Drive. New posts appear at the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Live preview (latest)</strong> shows how your current note
          will render (Markdown).
        </li>
        <li>
          Empty notes are not saved (you’ll be asked to write something first).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Passphrase and journals</h2>
      <p>
        Your passphrase is the key to your journal. LightJournal uses the
        passphrase to determine which journal file to open, and to
        decrypt/encrypt content.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Same passphrase</strong> → opens the same journal.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Different passphrase</strong> → a different journal (separate
          file).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you type a passphrase that has no journal yet, nothing is created
          until you press
          <strong>Save</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Show passphrase</strong> checkbox only changes visibility
          on your screen. It does not change encryption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Encryption (important)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your notes are encrypted <strong>on your device</strong> before
          upload.
        </li>
        <li>
          The encrypted file is stored in your Google Drive
          <strong>app data</strong> area.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you forget the passphrase, the journal cannot be decrypted. There
          is no recovery mechanism.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Autosave draft (local safety)</h2>
      <p>
        While you type, LightJournal saves a draft locally in your browser so
        you don’t lose text from accidental refresh or a crash. This draft:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>is stored only on the current device/browser (local storage)</li>
        <li>
          is cleared automatically when you successfully press
          <strong>Save</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          is not uploaded to Google Drive until you press <strong>Save</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disconnecting and reconnecting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Press <strong>Disconnect from Drive</strong> to return to a clean
          start. Loaded posts and preview are cleared on disconnect.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the session expires (for example after sleep), LightJournal may ask
          you to reconnect. Your draft text stays in the editor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Markdown tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blank line</strong> creates a new paragraph.</li>
        <li>
          A single Enter may not always create a line break in strict Markdown.
          On mobile keyboards, trailing spaces can be removed automatically.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use Markdown basics like <code>#</code> headings,
          <code>**bold**</code>, <code>*italic*</code>, lists, and links.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“Wrong passphrase”</strong>: the journal exists but cannot be
          decrypted with the passphrase you entered. Double-check spelling and
          keyboard layout.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“No journal yet for this passphrase”</strong>: write a note
          and press Save to create the journal for that passphrase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reconnect needed</strong>: your Drive session expired. Press
          Connect again.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data location</h2>
      <p>
        Journal files are stored in your Google Drive
        <strong>Application data</strong> area (not in your normal Drive
        folders). Uninstalling the app does not delete journals from Drive.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <p style="opacity: 0.7">
        LightJournal is intentionally simple. The core idea is: connect →
        passphrase → write → save.
