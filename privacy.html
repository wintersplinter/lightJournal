    <h1>LightJournal Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      LightJournal is a minimal journaling application designed to store user
      data privately.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Journal entries are stored in the user's own Google Drive account. Data is
      encrypted in the browser before being uploaded. The developer of
      LightJournal does not have access to journal content.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The LightJournal extension and website do not collect, transmit, or sell
      personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Account Access</h2>
    <p>
      LightJournal uses Google OAuth solely to allow the user to access their
      own Google Drive storage. Access is limited to the application's private
      app data folder.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      For questions regarding privacy, please contact the developer via the
      GitHub repository.
